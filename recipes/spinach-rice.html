        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spinach rice a.k.a <strong>spinirice</strong> is my own dish, and one of my overall
            favourites. The name is a combination of the words "spinach" and "rice,"
            and was influenced by the name of the Japanese dish <small>omurice.</small>
            The main ingredeints of spinirice are rice, cooked spinach
            and some form of meat.
        </p>

            Created in 2022 when I got tired of eating cheap spaghetti
            and instant noodles, spinirice originated as an easy to make dish,
            being comprised of whatever ingredients happened to be present
            at the time of making it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may contain miscellaneous vegetables, meat scraps, and different
            seasonings each time. Many of the ingredients are optional. This recipe
            lists my ideal way to make it.
            As long as it ends up tasting good there's no wrong way to make it.
        </p>

            Actually there is. Spinirice is to be eaten with a spoon alone, so everything
            should be chopped into bits (chicken, beef, whathaveyou).
