        <p>It consists of a pack of 3/$1.00 instant noodles, along with some fun stuff to spice it up.
            It's also a kitchenware-economic dish, requiring but a single pot and pan to cook.

            <li>Add a chunk of ground beef to the non stick pan. Fry and stir until cooked, adding a pinch
                of salt if desired. Pour the ground beef into the same bowl as the eggs
            </li>
            <li>Next add enough oil the pan to fry some french fries and allow to heat up</li>

            <li>Fill a pot with water and set on the stove to boil at medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling add a pack of instant noodles to the water and after about 30 seconds

            </li>
            <li>Cook the noodles until they're soft yet still retain some tasteful-chewing-experience quality</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove and empty all but a cup-full of water from the pot</li>
            <li>Add about 80% of the seasoning packet that came with the instant noodles, 
                a squirt of sriracha sauce, and the eggs and ground beef that was set aside in a bowl
            </li>
            <li>Mix together and serve</li>
        </ul>
